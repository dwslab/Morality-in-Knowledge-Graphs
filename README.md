# Morality in Knowledge Graphs

This repository contains the data from our paper **Knowledge Graphs meet Moral Values** (Hulpus et al, STARSEM 2020). As of now, we only uploaded our linking of the Moral Foundations Dictionary to the knowledge graphs. If you are interested in something else, please feel free to contact us.
